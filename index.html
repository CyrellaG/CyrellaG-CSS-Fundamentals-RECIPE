                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                    <p><strong>Butter Chicken</strong> is one of the most popular Indian curries favored by people around the world. This mildly spiced creamy chicken curry is well suited for any occasions and served in all kinds of eateries; right from roadside dhabas to top end restaurants!</p>
                    <p>Being an exotic dish, preparing butter chicken is always an exciting cooking experience in the kitchen. The core ingredients which make this recipe stand out are; a generous portion of garam masala which lifts the masala flavors, and the use of Kashmiri chili powder which provides color and adequate heat, not making it too spicy either. The recipe is slightly from the traditional take.</p>
                    <p>Serve this butter chicken with naan, roti (any flatbread), or rice, to make a perfect weeknight meal!</p>
                    <p>Tomatoes / Tomato puree: The creamy tomato-based sauce is another highlight of this recipe, and to prepare you could make your own with medium sized ripe tomatoes, sautéed with onions, and then ground to make the thick sauce. One last extra step would be to then sieve the sauce through a strainer to make it silky smooth.</p>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You can use fresh tomatoes instead of tomato puree; saute 4 tomatoes along with onions, then grind it into a thick paste, and finally sieve to make a fine silky-smooth paste.</li>
            <li>Adjust the spice levels of this dish to your choice by adding regular chili powder instead of Kashmiri chili powder.</li>
